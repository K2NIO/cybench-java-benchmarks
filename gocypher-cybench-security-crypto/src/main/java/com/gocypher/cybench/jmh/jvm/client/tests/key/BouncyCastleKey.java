//     * AES is a symmetric key cipher. This means the same secret key is used for both encryption and decryption,
//     * and both the sender and receiver of the data need a copy of the key. By contrast, asymmetric key systems
//     * use a different key for each of the two processes. Asymmetric keys are best for external file transfers,
//     * whereas symmetric keys are better suited to internal encryption. The advantage of symmetric systems like
//     * AES is their speed. Because a symmetric key algorithm requires less computational power than an asymmetric
//     * one, itâ€™s faster and more efficient to run.
//     * <p>
//     * AES is also characterized as a block cipher. In this type of cipher, the information to be encrypted
//     * (known as plaintext) is divided into sections called blocks. AES uses a 128-bit block size, in which data
//     * is divided into a four-by-four array containing 16 bytes. Since there are eight bits per byte, the total in
//     * each block is 128 bits. The size of the encrypted data remains the same: 128 bits of plaintext yields 128
//     * bits of ciphertext.

     * What we all call <strong>Triple DES</strong> operates in three steps: Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt (EDE). It works by taking three
     * 56-bit keys (K1, K2 and K3), and encrypting first with K1, decrypting next with K2 and encrypting a last time
     * with K3.
     * <p>
     * 3DES has two-key and three-key versions. In the two-key version, the same algorithm runs three times, but uses
     * K1 for the first and last steps. In other words, K1 = K3. Note that if K1 = K2 = K3, then Triple DES is
     * really Single DES.
     * <p>
     * Triple DES was created back when DES was becoming weaker than users accepted. As a result, they sought an
     * easy way to get more strength. In a system that is dependent on DES, making a composite function out of
     * multiple passes of DES is likely to be easier than bolting in a new symmetric cipher. This has the added
     * benefit of sidestepping the political issues that arise from arguing about the relative strength of a new
     * cipher versus DES.
